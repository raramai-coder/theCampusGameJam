  personalQuestion1: What happened to the other glove?
  personalQuestion2: How do you not see black officers as traitors?
  answer1: After witnessing the June 16th Soweto Youth uprising and seeing how over
    1000 teenagers/young adults were injured by the police force. I vowed to do everything
    I could to stop those who have colonised us.
  answer2: Fight violence with violence.
  answer3: I lost one, whilst crossing over the Limpopo River from South Africa into
    Mozambique
  answer4: My brother is a prison warden, they are just doing their jobs.
  thought1: He's a skilled boxer, and I heard that he met with Robert Subukwe in
    person for legal advice.
  thought2: He's too sympathetic towards black traitors who guard the prisons.
