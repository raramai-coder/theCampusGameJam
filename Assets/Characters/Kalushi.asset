  personalQuestion1: Why was your sentence shortened?
  personalQuestion2: How did your brother end up in jail?
  answer1: When my brother was sent to prison, the police officers beat my brother
    to the ground. When the same thing happened to me a few years later, I knew I
    was going to fight to ensure that never would another innocent black be treated
    like that again.
  answer2: Fight violence with violence.
  answer3: How does that concern you? Mind your own business.
  answer4: He went to prison for stabbing a police officer.
  thought1: He received a 10 year prison sentence, but got out 5 years early, no
    one knows how. But one things is for sure, the Apartheid governement doesn't
    just give leniency like that to black prisoners.
